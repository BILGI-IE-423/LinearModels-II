## Linear Models II - Exercises

- Import `car.csv` and check the dataset.
- Find unique values for all categorical variables
- Visualize the class distribution
- Visualize the distribution of car acceptability classes across different safety levels using a count plot.
- Conduct preprocessing
- Perform a train-test split using 70% training, 30% testing with `random_state=42`
- Train a linear support vector machine model with default parameters and print confusion matrix
- Is there a class imbalance problem? If so, how can we tackle this?
- Re-perform the work using logistic regression and compare the results.
